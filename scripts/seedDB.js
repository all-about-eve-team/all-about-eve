Screening tests for cervical cancer include:</p><ul><li>Pap tests, also called Pap smears</li><li>HPV (human papillomavirus) tests</li></ul><p>These tests can help find cervical cells that are infected with HPV or other abnormal cells <strong>before</strong> they turn into cervical cancer.</p><p>Most cervical cancers can be prevented by regular screeningsâ€“ and the right follow-up treatment when needed.</p><h3>How often should I get screened (tested)?</h3><p>How often you need to get screened depends on how old you are and which screening tests you get.</p><p>If you are age 21 to 29, get screened with a Pap test every 3 years.</p><p>If you are age 30 to 65, you have 3 options:</p><ul><li>Get screened every 3 years with a Pap test</li><li>Get screened every 5 years with an HPV test..</li><li>Get screened every 5 years with both a Pap test and an HPV test.</li></ul><p>Talk with your doctor about which option is right for you. Some women may also need to get screened more often. For example, your doctor may recommend that you get screened more often if you've had abnormal test results in the past.</p><p>If you are age 66 or older, ask your doctor if you need to continue getting screened for cervical cancer. </p><h3>What is cervical cancer?</h3><p>Cervical cancer is cancer of the cervix, which is the low, narrow part of the uterus that connects the uterus to the vagina.</p><p><img alt='Picture of a woman's lower reproductive organs including the fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, vagina, and cervix.' src='https://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/ContentImages/cerv_cancer.gif'/</p><p>Abnormal cells in the cervix can turn into cancer if they aren't found and treated. Cervical cancer is most commonly found in women who don't get regular screenings.</p><h3><strong>What causes cervical cancer?</strong></h3><p>Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by certain types of HPV (human papillomavirus). Some types of HPV cause genital warts, and others cause cancer. HPV is the most common infection spread through sex (vaginal, anal, and oral). </p><p>In most cases, HPV infections go away on their own. But when they last for a long time, they can cause cancer. <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/std/HPV/STDFact-HPV.htm'>Get more information on HPV infection.</a></p><p>Learn more about cervical cancer and screening:</p><ul><li><a href='http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/pdf/cervical_facts.pdf'>Cervical Cancer [PDF - 897 KB]</a></li><li><a href='https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/understanding-cervical-changes'>Understanding Cervical Changes: Next Steps After an Abnormal Screening Test</a></li><li><a href='https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/patient/cervical-screening-pdq#section/all'>Cervical Cancer Screening</a></li></ul><h3>What happens during cervical cancer screening tests?</h3><p>Cervical cancer screening tests usually happen as part of a pelvic exam. During this exam, you lie on your back on an exam table, bend your knees, and put your feet into stirrups.</p><p>While you lie on the exam table, the doctor or nurse will put a medical tool (called a speculum) into your vagina and open it to see your cervix. The doctor or nurse will use a special brush to collect some cells from your cervix. These cells will be sent to a lab, where an expert will check for abnormal cells or for the types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer.</p><p>These tests take about 5 minutes. It may feel uncomfortable, but it usually doesn't hurt. </p><p>Learn more about cervical screening tests:</p><ul><li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003911.htm'>Pap tests</a></li><li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/human-papillomavirus-hpv-test/'>HPV tests</a></li></ul><h4>What else happens during a pelvic exam?</h4><p>Cervical cancer screening is just part of a pelvic exam.
