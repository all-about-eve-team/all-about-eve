# Project Goals

All About Eve is a crowd-sourcing health page by women, for women. We wanted to create a space for women to discuss women's health issues and products openly and frankly.

# Sections

## Forum

The Forum allows users to post a question and answer other users' questions. 

## Product Review

The Product Review section allows users to post reviews of feminine products and to comment on other users' reviews.

## Articles

The Articles section allows users to research various topics from Healthfinder.gov.

# Flow

The homepage of All About Eve provides some inspiration for what users can discuss on the app. 

First, the user creates an account. Presently, username, password, and email are the only required fields.

Once the user has created an account, they will be redirected to the login page.
